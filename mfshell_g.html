<p><h2>ü§î Introduction</h2>
<p>In telegram, most URL uploaders and leechers have this "boomerang" effect, you give them something, wether it's a file i Telegram or a URL, they do their thing and then they upload it to the chat, this is considered "normal". The first thing you need to know is that MF Shell is not a "normal" bot, because this "boomerang effect" does not exist, mainly because there are two ways to get the files: the typical upload and web server sharing, AKA: File-to-Link
<p><h3>MF Shell features</h3>
<p>‚Üí You can organize as you like the files you put in the bot: create directories (folders), move, delete, create archives and even encrypt files
<p>‚Üí Great number of supported platforms to download from
<p>‚Üí Mass processing of files/URLs 
<p>‚Üí Queue systems and tools for handling them
<p>‚Üí Integrated web server for direct downloads and streaming (File-To-Link)

<p><h3>Basically in any session this is the typical workflow</h3>
<p>1 - Download files to the bot
<p>2 - Refactor the files, reorganize them, do anything with them in the bot
<p>3 - Upload to the Telegram chat or share using the web server
<p>

<p>La gu√≠a ha resultado ser densa para muchos usuarios, es por eso que en esta publicaci√≥n hay un tutorial de uso b√°sico del bot, donde se explica y se muestra casi todos los comandos m√°s usados del bot

<div class="w3-padding-16"><script async src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-widget.js?18" data-telegram-post="bots_of_charles/67" data-width="100%" data-dark="1"></script></div>

<div class="w3-panel w3-pale-red w3-leftbar w3-rightbar w3-border-red">
<p>En el tutorial se usa un comando llamado /zipper, este comando ya no existe en el bot, fue remplazado por /seven, que se usa pr√°cticamente igual y tiene algunas mejoras
<p>El tutorial no es el final, es solo la punta del iceberg, para entender todo, debe seguir leyendo hasta el final

<p><h2>üìÇ File system elements</h2>

<p><img src="show_mfshell_example1.png" style="width:100%;max-width:480px">
<p>In MF Shell each user has its own directory (folder) were the user can work, and inside, the user can create more subdirectories to group files and other subdirectories
<p>There's a location (path) considered as the "current location", which is the path where you are standing. You can see it (directory listing) by executing <code>/ls</code>, other commands like <code>/cd</code> and <code>/back</code> also do a directory listing
<p>The files and directories are organised and enumerated from zero as the first element, these enumerations are called indexes. Directories are listed before the files
<p>Elements above zero are the elements in the current location, below zero are the upper levels, for example, let's say you are in this path <code>/things/more/</code>, the parent path (-1) is <code>/things/</code>, the grand-parent is <code>/</code>, and above that there are no more upper levels, because "/" is the root
</div>


<div id="c3" class="w3-container w3-padding-32">
<p><h2>üëà Selection types</h2>

<p><img src="show_mfshell_example2.png" style="width:100%;max-width:480px">

<p>In MF Shell, all the commands that work with the file system, and the <code>/que</code> command, use selectors as arguments
<p>The selectors indicate a selection of elements. When the command has to do with the file system, it generally needs an element present in the current directory or an upper level relative to the current path
<p>There are 3 selection types

<p>‚Üí Simple select
<p>‚Üí Range select
<p>‚Üí Free select

<div class="w3-panel w3-pale-red w3-leftbar w3-rightbar w3-border-red">
<p>In the documentation for each command at the commands reference, depending on the command, the selection type is always specified
</div>

<p><h3>Simple select</h3>
<p>Selects an index as it is
<p>In the file system, selecting below zero selects upper levels, and above zero (including the zero), selects an element in the current path
<p>Format: N
<p>Examples:
<p><code class="cmd">/ls 3</code>
<p>Observes the element #3
<p>In the case the element #3 is a directory, the command outputs the content of the directory, if it's a file... it just shows the filename
<p><code class="cmd">/ls -1</code>
<p>Lists the contents of the parent directory
<p>Remember you cannot access or select in any way a directory above "/", because this is the root
<p>
<p><h3>Range select</h3>
<p>Range select is used for selecting multiple elements in a specified range
<p>Format: N-Mr/N-M
<p>N and M are numbers and "r" (literally, an "r") is an optional argument
<p>N is the main index
<p>M is the ammount of elements to select
<p>"r" is for selecting, but in reverse
<p>Examples:
<p><code class="cmd">/ls 4-3</code>
<p>Observe the indexes 4,5 and 6 in the current location
<p>In this example, 3 elements are selected starting with the element at index 4
<p><code class="cmd">/rm 5-2r</code>
<p>Deletes elements in index 4 and 5
<p>In this example, 2 elements are selected in reverse starting at index 5
<p><code class="cmd">/mv 4-0 2</code>
<p>Move all elements from index 4 to the directory at index 2
<p>
<p><h3>Free select</h3>
<p>The free select consists in selecting multiple indexes in a specified order
<p>In some commands, the order in which you select is important, this type of selecion is also useful for selecting non-consecutive indexes
<p>Format: A,B,C,D,E.....N
<p>The indexes are comma-separated
<p>You cannot repeat any elements
<p>There's no limit beyond the number of elements/indexes in the current path
<p>You cannot select less than two elements
<p>Examples:
<p><code class="cmd">/upload 4,5,1</code>
<p>Upload indexes 4,5 and 1 in that order
<p><code class="cmd">/mv 7,9,14 6</code>
<p>Move the elements at indexes 7, 9 y 14 to the subdirectory at index 6
</div>

<div id="c4" class="w3-container w3-padding-32">
<p><h2>‚öôÔ∏è Limits and queues</h2>

<p><h3>Network transfers and queues</h3>
<p>Each user has a limit of 2 paralel network transfers and globally, the limit is 5. The global limit can be adjusted at runtime by the admin
<p>Each network transfer command has it's own queue per user, which can be paused or cancelled
<p>Each queue has an identifier, this identifier is used in commands for queue administration
<p>For more information, read the Queue control commands at the commands reference
<p>
<p><h3>Regulated commands</h3>
<p>There are commands, or parts of them, where they perform CPU heavy or memory heavy jobs and jobs that use the bash shell directly
<p>And this is why in this bot, there are queues to avoid the users from executing these jobs at the same time and avoid issues like data raises
<p>Network transfer commands also consume a lot of resources in the bot besides the bandwith, this is why in case the amount of network transfers reached the maximum and a user wants to download or upload something, it will have to wait in a queue called NIO queue until one of the transfers has finished
<p>
<p><h3>Sessions limit</h3>
<p>In each instance of the bot running there's a daily user limit, which can be adjusted by the admin
<p>By default the limit is 100 users, in case the limit is reached and a user wants to start a session in the bot, the user will recieve a message saying the limit has been reached and it will be black listed by the bot to ignore the user. This will only last until the bot is reset
</div>

<div id="c5" class="w3-container w3-padding-32">
<p><h2>‚úçÔ∏è Extra knowledge</h2>
<p>The <code>/start</code> gives displays usefu√±l information about the current session, so you don't get lost. Some data is not visible through this command though
<p>If an automatic queue or a command stops working, you must report to the administrator through the group. The admin is the only user capable of resetting user sessions and other components in the bot
<p>Each MF Shell account has it's own website attached. In this website, there's a news section in which you can see the bot's uptime, this is important because the bot is reset automatically every 24 and a half hours, <font color=red>purging everything inside it</font>, so if you are thinking about leaving files to pick up later through the server (this is the only reason you might do this), you first need to check the bot's uptime
<p>Maintainances and updates are normally notified in the BoC channel, but when the bot is reset automatically by the hosting provider, the admin may do a patch or an update in the bot at that time
